MONUSCO troops were able to prevent the M23’s seizure, upon withdrawal, of FARDC ammunitions and equipment left within airport premises in GOMA.  In GOMA proper, the situation remained calm at the time of writing; some 689 PNC personnel have now arrived there (more police reinforcements are expected early this week); an FARDC battalion is also expected to arrive in GOMA today. This past weekend also saw the return of the mayor to GOMA, whilst provincial government and assembly members are anticipated in the city today. An M23 spokesperson was cited yesterday warning that its combatants would return to GOMA should the Congolese government fail to agree to talks by the end of today - this past Friday, Mayi-Mayi (Kiricho, Yakutumba, and RM) leaders in South Kivu called upon the GoDRC to include them in any negotiations with the M23. Separately, MONUSCO has received reports of rape and looting by armed uniformed personnel in the MUGUNGA III IDP camp over the past few days.

30-Nov-12,MONUSCO,"  In recent briefings to lawmakers, Congolese officials reiterated accusations of Rwandan interference in eastern DRC and alleged a CNDP failure to respect earlier (23 March 2009) peace agreement terms. Residents of Rwanda’s Rubavu district are reportedly concerned about abductions being undertaken by suspected FDLR. Speaking from MINOVA (South Kivu) yesterday, FARDC Gen. Francois Olenga Tete was cited dismissing the potential of negotiations and making preparations for “war” in order to re-take GOMA. Media reports anticipate the arrival in GOMA today of a senior ICGLR delegation charged with verifying the hoped-for withdrawal of M23 combatants (other media sources refer to the arrival in GOMA of some 300 PNC personnel, whose reported purpose is to security the city in anticipation of an M23 departure). MONUSCO reports no substantive movement thus far, from either GOMA or SAKE, of M23 elements; an aerial reconnaissance effort will reportedly be made if an unconfirmed 48 hour delay in the M23’s withdrawal from GOMA (to KIBUMBA) comes to pass. In the interim, the Mission has received reports of looting and attacks on residents by M23; rebels’ recruitment of child combatants is also of noted concern. Security concerns prompted the withdrawal earlier this week of implementing partners from IDP camps in Masisi and Rutshuru territories. Also earlier this week, at KALEMBE (North Kivu), civilians sought refuge at MONUSCO premises following clashes between FARDC and Cheka combatants. In Orientale province, there was word yesterday of renewed activity by FRPI elements in Ituri district.

Following calls for urgent contributions to be made to a proposed NIF, ICGLR stakeholders are reportedly due to meet in KAMPALA tomorrow (M23 notables claim to be in contact with Ugandan officials there). Other media reports refer to recent GoE allegations of, inter alia, senior Rwandan and Ugandan officials’ support of armed group activity in eastern DRC; GoE conclusions also prompted President Kabila yesterday to suspend the FARDC’s Gen. Amisi. Meanwhile, the recent outbreak of violence has prompted the expression of anti-MONUSCO sentiment in several locations this week, including KINSHASA, KINDU (Maniema province) and in BUNIA (Orientale province), where UN agency premises and three staff member residences were looted and one UN vehicle was damaged. There are indications of rising tensions in BUKAVU (South Kivu), where PNC personnel responded to demonstrations on Wednesday.

An effort by some M23 combatants to remove munitions from GOMA airport was prevented on Wednesday in a standoff with MONUSCO troops. The M23 remain in control of SAKE while peacekeepers there continue to provide for the protection of some IDPs gathered at the MONUSCO camp.

Meanwhile, tensions persist in Jonglei state’s Pibor county. There was unconfirmed word of looting near UNMISS premises at PIBOR late on Wednesday; yesterday, in PIBOR and in LIKUANGOLE, SPLA troops received fire from rebel elements. In Western Bahr el-Ghazal state, near FIRKA and SIRI MALAGA, it is suggested that disgruntled SPLA troops are abandoning their posts and, en route back home, are moving toward AWEIL and WAU.

Meanwhile, unrest appeared yesterday to be radiating beyond North Kivu’s Rutshuru territory, with serious implications for the Mission and UN agencies. Early yesterday, student protests in BUNIA (Orientale province) resulted in two UN vehicles torched, UN agency offices looted and a MONUSCO guest house damaged by fire (a local church and offices of President Kabila's PPRD party also sustained damage). Similar unrest was reported yesterday at KISANGANI, where a number of UN vehicles were destroyed, local MONUSCO premises were damaged by fire and PPRD offices and the Provincial Assembly were targeted by protestors. Tensions continue today in BUNIA and in BUTEMBO and WALIKALE, in North Kivu.

A number of North Kivu officials have re-located (some with MONUSCO assistance) and are at BENI. Today, some 600 people – including numbers of PNC and FARDC – participated in an M23 rally at GOMA’s stadium, where rebel representatives have declared their intent to expand operations (specific mention was made of BUKAVU, in South Kivu).

In South Kivu, local FARDC commanders met this past Monday to consider inter alia, ways to prevent further defections among their rank-and-file. There is belated word of an attack last Friday in which FNL rebels killed three Congolese troops south of BARAKA. In Orientale Province, there is word of FRPI leader Cobra Matata’s recent disinclination to negotiate with Congolese authorities.

It is claimed that a local SPLA commander was informed but has yet to take any actions in response. WFP flights from Ethiopia have begun airdropping food supplies to IDPs in MABAN (Upper Nile state) in response to continued fighting between SAF and SPLM-N in Sudan’s Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile states. The possibility of establishing a UNMISS County Support Base in PANYIJAR (Unity state) was positively considered by local officials at a recent meeting in BENTIU. The Mission was informed of clashes yesterday involving some 100 youth from Warrap and Lakes states; three Dinka Gok were believed killed.  
15-Aug-12,UNAMA,"  Media reports describe yesterday as being the deadliest day for Afghan civilians so far this year, with upwards of 40 people killed in three separate attacks (in Nimroz, Kunduz and Badakhshan provinces). Meanwhile, Afghan and Pakistani officials have reportedly agreed to undertake a joint investigation of the recent surge in cross-border attacks.  "
15-Aug-12,UNMOGIP,"  Pakistani authorities submitted four complaints yesterday alleging unprovoked cross-LoC fire by Indian forces on Monday in Muzaffarabad, Sialkot and Jammu districts.  "

14-Aug-12,UNSMIS,"  Syrian officials were cited yesterday expressing the government’s willingness to engage the opposition in “logical discussions” supervised by President al-Assad. Following his recent defection to Jordan, ex-PM Riyad Hijab was cited alleging that Syria’s government was “decaying morally and deteriorating militarily”. A junior member of the Syrian Mission to the UN in GENEVA reportedly defected yesterday. Chinese officials are reportedly considering fresh visits by opposition notables while, in anticipation of a meeting to begin today, OIC ministers in MECCA have reportedly recommended that Syria be expelled from the body. The potential establishment of a no-fly zone in Syria, called for by senior SNC representatives, continues to generate mixed reactions from international stakeholders. UNSMIS officials were cited yesterday warning of increased violence in several areas; targeted opposition attacks and the SAAF’s indiscriminate use of heavy weapons continue to result in civilian suffering. A senior OCHA delegation has arrived in Syria today to discuss humanitarian planning requirements. Meanwhile, the Mission reports continued military operations in outlying areas of DAMASCUS. Also in the capital, a traffic accident involving two UN vehicles resulted in a staff member injured this past Sunday. There has been no reported improvement in the situation within ALEPPO. Similar concerns have been expressed about circumstances in DEIR EZ-ZOR following yesterday’s downing of Syrian fighter aircraft. The past day has seen government artillery fire target the city’s al-Howakah district; FSA elements are believed still in place in and around DEIR EZ-ZOR. Combat has been reported in DAR’A while, in HOMS yesterday, rooftop observation efforts suggest relative calm. Heavy weapons use by government forces appeared concentrated in the city’s al-Hamediya and Khaldiya areas. The overall situation in Homs and Hama governorates has been characterised by the Mission as “tense and volatile”. Recently posted on-line video content has been the subject of some media interest, with reports referring to footage claiming to show abusive rebel behaviour and, separately, an alleged interview of a Hezbollah combatant captured by opposition forces.  "
14-Aug-12,UNDOF,  Mission sources continue to report multiple instances of unauthorized military personnel and equipment (mostly Syrian) in the AoS; instances of firing have also been reported.  
14-Aug-12,Somalia," (UNSOA)  There has been recent cause for concern regarding the security situation in MOGADISHU, the announced implementation of enhanced measures notwithstanding. The presence of private militia elements, with differing loyalties, has been reported in the capital. Yesterday, UNPOS noted biased behaviour among police personnel charged with supporting presidential election campaign efforts (challengers to incumbent President Sheikh Sharif appear to face obstacles). This past weekend, in response to violence in Xamar Weyne district, AMISOM warned presidential candidate Muhammad Abdullahi Farmajo of the need to keep his supporters under control. Meanwhile, international stakeholders have expressed recent concern about delays in the selection of new MPs. Beyond MOGADISHU, there was word last week of a possible al-Shabaab mobilization against Ethiopian forces in HUDUR (Bakool region).  "
14-Aug-12,MONUSCO,"  Media reports anticipate a meeting of ICGLR defence ministry officials in GOMA tomorrow, where the prospect of a neutral force being deployed in DRC’s eastern region is to be discussed. Meanwhile, the situation in North Kivu remains tenuous. There is belated word of an attack by M23 combatants at MAIYAMOTO where, last Friday, they looted several vehicles. Villages were torched and five people were recently killed by Mayi-Mayi seeking out suspected FDLR in Masisi territory. The Mission also received word yesterday of FARDC troops collecting illegal taxes at NYANZALE. In South Kivu, FDLR are suspected of killing 11 civilians in an attack last Friday on KALONGE.

Meanwhile, yesterday also saw unknown armed elements seize control of FRCI positions at a crossing point south-west of TOULEPLEU, near the border with Liberia. There is unconfirmed word of two Ivorian security personnel injured in this attack; many locals and some humanitarian staff were also prompted to leave the area. An overflight by an armed UN helicopter was organised, FRCI reinforcements were deployed and control was subsequently regained. On its side of the border, Liberian reinforcements were also deployed to TOE TOWN. There is belated word of Dozo checkpoints established this past weekend on routes between DUÉKOUÉ and BLODY; illegal checkpoints manned by FRCI personnel have been recently documented south of TAÏ.  "

14-Aug-12,UNMIK,"  Instances of low-level violence have been recently reported in MITROVICA, including ethnically-motivated clashes between youth groups, an explosion at a restaurant and acts of vandalism. "
13-Aug-12,UNSMIS,"  There was weekend media interest in how the UN might maintain an ""effective and flexible presence"" in Syria beyond 19 August, when UNSMIS' current mandate is due to expire. Last Friday saw rumoured JSE candidate Lakhdar Brahimi call for unity between UNSC and regional states in hopes of ensuring a swift political transition in Syria. PM Wael Nader al-Halqi, designated last Thursday following the previous incumbent's defection, has been sworn into office by President al-Assad. Other Syrian officials have recently accused Qatar, Turkey and Saudi Arabia of “harbouring, funding and arming the armed terrorist groups""; in correspondence last Friday, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the US and Israel were also accused of coordinating military operations from Turkish territory. Following her meeting with Turkish officials, America's secretary of state was cited this weekend announcing the US’s intent to establish, with Turkey, a working group to plan for worst-case scenarios (mention was reportedly made of concerns about chemical weapons use). Germany's foreign minister was cited expressing opposition to foreign military intervention in Syria; on Saturday, he also indicated a preference for Syria's president to appear before the ICC (legal proceedings, however, would need to be secondary to other means having potential to prevent further bloodshed). A minor medical procedure required by Saudi Arabia's foreign minister required yesterday’s postponement of a planned League of Arab States meeting. Meanwhile, media reports and Mission sources referred to persistent (albeit at an uneven tempo) combat in disparate locations over the weekend. In DAMASCUS Saturday, there was an explosion in proximity to UNSMIS HQ premises (responded to with gunfire from SAAF troops); no injuries or damage to UN property was reported. Yesterday, UNSMIS reported on the recent killing of a local staff member, who disappeared late last Thursday at an FSA checkpoint north of the capital. The Mission suggests that the staff member was likely targeted due to his alleged prior affiliation with Syrian state security; his body, since recovered, shows signs of possible torture. Overall, shelling and exchanges of fire were reported in DAMASCUS’ outlying areas and in villages in Rif Damascus. Beyond the capital, the situation in ALEPPO continues to require the RTS' temporary relocation. According to the Mission, the general situation in ALEPPO remains volatile, with an escalated level of violence reported this weekend inside the city. Media sources report shelling in a number of neighbourhoods; other local media sources anticipate a SAAF ground advance on the Sukari district. Security concerns in DEIR EZ-ZOR have forced the Mission to curtail patrolling activity. The RTS there reports the SAAF’s sustained use of attack helicopters in al Mayadden district was reported over the weekend, as was government forces’ shelling of various areas in and around the city. Fixed-wing fighter activity was reported above DEIR EZ-ZOR yesterday; FSA sources claim today to have shot down one such aircraft, capturing its pilot. UNSMIS reports that circumstances in Homs and Hama governorates remain volatile and unstable. Air strikes and heavy weapons use is reported in HOMS, including in the city’s central districts. Opposition sources allege a militia round-up of civilians there, resulting in ten killed; subsequent opposition reports claim the defection of a local police commander. HOMS’ governor claims that the government intends, in the near future, to release a number of detainees; UNSMIS will be invited to witness the event. As regards sensitive border matters, reports last Friday referred to clashes between Syrian and Jordanian forces. On Saturday, elements of the LAF reportedly deployed to locations along the border with Syria in an effort to restore calm among residents there. UNSMIS informs that static SAAF checkpoints line the entire route from DAMASCUS to the Lebanese border. There is breaking news in Turkish media suggesting contradictory explanations of the downing, in June, of a Turkish fighter aircraft (ostensibly by Syrian air defence forces). Humanitarian actors continue to express alarm about a “deteriorating” situation in Syria. UNHCR stated this weekend that some 150,000 Syrian refugees have so far been registered in neighbouring countries. Humanitarian sources inform today of USG Amos’ intent to visit Syria and Lebanon on 14-16 August.  "
13-Aug-12,UNTSO,"  The Mission responded yesterday to incorrect media reports of an attack on a UN peacekeeping camp (an Egyptian security checkpoint in the Sinai region was fired at earlier on in the day). In subsequent reports, Egyptian troops engaged five militants at AL GOURA, close to the Israeli border. A number of senior officials have been dismissed by Egypt’s president in response to recent unrest in the Sinai region.  "
13-Aug-12,UNAMID,"  Two peacekeepers were killed in separate incidents in Southern Darfur this past weekend. A UNAMID vehicle en route from ED DAEIN to NYALA overturned late Saturday; one staff member was killed and nine other vehicle occupants were injured (including one seriously). Early yesterday, civilian-clad attackers opened fire on FPU personnel deployed at the UNAMID Community Policing Centre in the Otash IDP camp (near NYALA); one FPU member was killed in the ensuing firefight and a second peacekeeper was wounded. In Northern Darfur, FPU reinforcements were recently deployed to IDP camp premises at KUTUM following reports of continued population displacement resulting from persistent clashes between militia and SAF troops. (Last Thursday, local NGOs criticized UNAMID for its perceived failure to intervene to “[…] prevent the situation [at the Kassab IDP camp] from worsening”.) Last Friday saw NISS personnel attacked (and two killed) in a carjacking incident some 15 km south-west of KUTUM; Arab militia are suspected of involvement. Also on Friday, there was local media speculation that JEM rebel commander Bakheit Abdallah Abdel-Karim (Dabajo) had been relieved from his post. The same day saw mention made of damage caused by heavy rainfall in areas of Central and Western Darfur.  "
13-Aug-12,UNMISS,"  In Jonglei state’s Pibor county, local officials have asked SPLA troops to end civilian disarmament efforts in hopes of preventing the alienation of Murle youth and their subsequent recruitment into forces loyal to David Yau Yau. Last Friday, residents of the same county alleged that upwards of 20 people (including women and children) were recently assaulted by SPLA troops engaged in disarmament activity. Ill-discipline among other GRSS security personnel has also been recently reported in Upper Nile state, at MELUT (where a uniformed staff member was harassed last Thursday) and in other locations. Last Friday saw IOM warn that funding shortfalls could impact ongoing efforts to relocate some 20,000 nationals from RENK to JUBA, in Central Equatoria state. More recently, members of the Federation of UN National staff associations in South Sudan have today organised a peaceful procession in JUBA (and in other locations) to follow up on an earlier request to have their salaries paid in US dollars.  "
13-Aug-12,UNISFA,"  Incomplete progress was reported Saturday following the conclusion, in ABYEI, of the sixth AJOC meeting. Key principles to ensure the peaceful co-existence of Misseriya and Dinka Ngok were agreed to; however, AJOC co-chairs reportedly failed to agree on any additional measures concerning inter-community dialogue, nor was there agreement reached on any other issue outstanding from the previous AJOC gathering (on 05 July). The next AJOC meeting is due to take place on 10 September.  "
13-Aug-12,Somalia," (UNSOA)  There is media interest today in the reported disappearance, over Kenyan territory, of three Ugandan military helicopters dispatched to reinforce AMISOM. Meanwhile, OCHA warned last Friday of an estimated one million refugees having fled Somalia due to persistent insecurity and declining food resources.  "
13-Aug-12,MONUSCO,"  Last Friday saw opposition notables issue a statement explaining their reasons for refusing an offer from the PM to discuss recent circumstances in the country’s eastern regions; mention was made of the alleged “fraudulent” character of last year’s elections. Also Friday, media reports cited international stakeholder representatives expressing some “scepticism” about the proposed establishment of a neutral force to be deployed to the east. Meanwhile, in North Kivu, M23 combatants continue to collect illegal taxes from locations in Rutshuru territory; intensified M23 patrolling has also been reported near RUGARI. In South Kivu, upwards of 1,000 BUKAVU residents gathered on Saturday to protest suspected government talks with the M23; two PNC officers were injured in the violence. There were reports of a small FARDC contingent at KANYOLA defecting (and then returning) this past weekend. This weekend also saw FARDC troops prepare for operations against Mayi-Mayi and FDLR combatants in Kalehe territory. In Province Orientale, the Mission has received reports of, inter alia, children abducted (by Mayi-Mayi) and four girls raped (by FARDC troops).  "
13-Aug-12,UNOCI,"  In a meeting last Thursday with the SRSG, senior Ivorian officials referred to their possession of information sufficient to show the involvement of pro-Gbagbo militia groups in recent attacks undertaken against security forces. Speaking last Friday as Head of the Ivorian Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Charles Konan Banny condemned these attacks and called on the government to support the reconciliation process. There are rumours of a planned attack against FRCI checkpoints and mosques in the DUÉKOUÉ area.  "
13-Aug-12,West Africa,  Media reports yesterday cite the interim president’s “renewed confidence” in Mali’s PM Diarra; Traore has also reportedly pressed for a new government of national unity to be announced within 72 hours’ time.

Yesterday, also in the capital, a UN vehicle was stopped by four knife-wielding assailants; the driver had his property stolen but was otherwise uninjured. Last Friday, a high-level defence ministry official (one of the first to defect to the opposition last year) was shot dead in BENGHAZI. "

13-Aug-12,UNAMA,"  Media sources anticipate the release, from Pakistani authority, of Taliban notable Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar as part of efforts to reinvigorate reconciliation initiatives between the Afghan government and the Taliban. Other media reports refer to at least ten ANP officers killed in Nimroz province on Saturday; the attacker was believed disguised in uniform or otherwise a member of the force. Last Friday saw the Taliban reject UNAMA estimates that anti-government armed elements were responsible for 80 percent of recent civilian deaths.  "
13-Aug-12,UNMOGIP,  Three ceasefire violation complaints were received from Pakistani authorities yesterday; unprovoked fire across the LoC by Indian forces in Poonch district is alleged. Indian media sources report one soldier injured when Pakistani forces allegedly opened fire on Saturday in Jammu district. 
10-Aug-12,UNSMIS,"  There is media interest in a potential successor to JSE Annan; Lakhdar Brahimi’s candidacy was speculated in reports yesterday. Yesterday also saw senior American officials express a willingness to consider a continued UN presence in Syria, albeit one with a reconfigured political and humanitarian focus. Iran’s foreign minister was cited yesterday expressing his country’s support of UN efforts to resolve the crisis in Syria; also yesterday, his Turkish counterpart accused Syria of arming PKK (Kurdish) militants. Media reports today anticipate a visit to Turkey this weekend by America’s secretary of state. UN sources in Lebanon have shared word of Fatah reportedly considering deploying combatants to Syria; their stated purpose would be to protect Palestinian refugees and camps there. Today, the UK foreign minister has announced Britain’s provision of an additional $US 7.7 million worth of non-lethal aid to Syrian opposition forces. Meanwhile, UNSMIS is providing reports (often unconfirmed) of continued fighting in disparate locations. Sporadic combat and shelling is ongoing in DEIR EZ-ZOR and HOMS; however, the tempo of fighting in both locations remains of a lower intensity (the Mission does note, however, a recent SAAF bombardment of HOMS’ Sultaniyah neighbourhood). There were unconfirmed reports yesterday of shelling in a number of locations within Idlib governorate, at KAFR ROMA, KAFR NABL, SARAQIB and KHAN SOBL. There is similarly-unconfirmed word of clashes in outlying areas of Dar’a governorate. In ALEPPO, the Mission has received unconfirmed reports of ongoing fighting in a number of different parts of the city. Opposition forces claim that upwards of 120 supporters were killed there yesterday; they also claim credit for destroying five armoured vehicles and inflicting an unknown number of SAAF casualties. The ICRC announced a successful delivery of food and medical supplies to ALEPPO yesterday. OHCHR warned yesterday of the severe nature of the IDP crisis in Syria; UNHCR estimates today that there are upwards of 150,000 Syrian refugees.  "

Meanwhile, that same day saw a peacekeeper sustain slight injuries when patrol members were pelted with stones in PORT-AU-PRINCE. "
10-Aug-12,UNOCI,"  The Mission continues to assist Ivorian authorities in their enhanced monitoring of security developments. FRCI troops continue their search for weapons and anti-government elements, with a particular focus in ABIDJAN, DUEKOUE and in ABENGOUROU (where peacekeepers were informed yesterday by Ivorian security personnel of still-unfulfilled requests for reinforcements). Residents of BINGERVILLE have accused FRCI troops there of extortion and abuse. Meanwhile, ministerial-level visits were made yesterday to review the conditions in which former Gbagbo notables are being detained.  "

9-Aug-12,UNSMIS,"  Health Minister Wael al-Halki has been appointed prime minister today by President al-Assad. There is media interest in France’s call for a 30 August ministerial-level UNSC meeting on developments (particularly humanitarian aspects) in Syria. There is other media speculation about the differing views held among Member States regarding the perceived efficacy of appointing a replacement JSE. Meanwhile, American officials were cited yesterday keeping open the potential of a no-fly-zone imposed over Syria. Iran’s foreign minister has stated that the group of Iranian nationals being detained by opposition forces in Syria include retired military and Revolutionary Guard members – all of whom were on a religious pilgrimage and were not, as is being claimed by opposition elements, undertaking reconnaissance. Russian officials are cited denying opposition claims that a senior Russian military official acting in an advisory capacity to the Syrian government was among those killed in an attack in DAMASCUS yesterday. Other media reports referred to some opposition commanders’ signature of a so-called “code of conduct” by which efforts would be made on the battlefield to respect human rights. In parallel to these developments, continued heavy fighting is being reported in ALEPPO, where there is still-unconfirmed word of a recent SAAF advance on the ground and where, early Wednesday, rebel commanders referred to shelling and bombing attacks there reportedly reaching “new levels of intensity” (control of the city’s Salah al-Din district remains especially contested). The Mission reports no change in the tempo of fighting and associated shelling in HOMS and in DEIR EZ-ZOR where, earlier today, UNMOs escaped injury when three rounds of small arms fire impacted two UNSMIS vehicles.

9-Aug-12,UNOCI,"  A number of Ivorian security officials (some senior) have been removed from their posts or otherwise face punitive actions in response to the recent spate of militia attacks on security forces (an FRCI checkpoint south of AGBOVILLE was attacked yesterday, with two soldiers injured). In a statement yesterday, the interior minister announced that at least eight arrests had been made; one suspect has alleged the involvement of Gbagbo sympathisers. Also as regards the Ivorian security sector, Mission sources report that Council of Minister members have approved the establishment of a national DDR body to deal with ex-combatant matters. Yesterday also saw the Commission of Inquiry on events relating to post-electoral crisis events submit its report to President Ouattara; it is stated in the report that, of 3,248 persons killed, 1,452 were victims of so-called “pro-Gbagbo forces”.  "
9-Aug-12,MONUSCO,"  Among the reported accomplishments of the recently-concluded ICGLR summit was the agreed establishment of a committee which, comprising regional defence ministers, is tasked with proposing “actionable steps to ensure that fighting in eastern DRC stops completely” and “provide details on the operationalisation of the neutral international force”. Summit participants also agreed to consider the re-establishment of the Team of Special Envoys and to establish a Humanitarian Assistance Fund in support of affected populations. Meanwhile, tensions persist in North Kivu. There is word of some 45 Mayi-Mayi elements joining M23 rebels at KIWANJA yesterday. There is belated word of a Mayi-Mayi attack which resulted in two PNC officers killed south-east of BUTEMBO. In South Kivu, there is concern about recent inter-communal tensions having potential to disrupt southerly traffic from BUKAVU; the arrival of new FARDC contingents in Fizi territory has prompted the displacement of some 4,000 people from LUBONJA. Far to the south, in Katanga province, the Mission met with UNHCR this past Tuesday to consider the circumstances of Angolan nationals (the deadline for repatriation expired on 30 June).  "
9-Aug-12,Somalia," (UNSOA)  Yesterday was the deadline by which the names of MP nominees for Somalia’s New Federal Parliament were to have been received by the Technical Selection Committee (TSC). More than 160 names have been received thus far; a TSC vetting process is due to begin once a quorum of 189 nominee names is obtained. UNPOS is aware of complaints and, inter alia, allegations of bribery and intimidation. UN sources also inform that, at a ceremony in MOGADISHU yesterday, President Sharif Sheikh Ahmed signed the Presidential Decree on the National Security and Stabilization Plan. Elsewhere in the capital, there are reports of a recent al-Shabaab attack on TFG-allied positions; media reports today mention at least eight TFG-allied militia members killed in a roadside bomb explosion in Huriwa district.

Clashes were reported in the city centre yesterday and media reports refer to SAAF artillery fire impacting opposition-held areas in the east. There are indications today of an advance by Syrian ground forces at ALEPPO; unconfirmed opposition sources allege the government’s recent movement of 50 armoured vehicles to ALEPPO from HAMA.

Elsewhere in North Kivu, last Friday saw 25 FARDC would-be deserters arrested in GOMA. In South Kivu, residents of MWENGA reportedly intend to establish a self-defence group in response to the FARDC’s perceived inability to secure the area. Elsewhere in the province, at BASOLO, there is word of government troops exchanging fire with deserters this past weekend, killing six. The Mission has expressed recent concern about the forcible recruitment of civilians (including children) by armed groups in eastern DRC; particular mention was made of the M23.

7-Aug-12,UNSMIS,"  There was media interest in yesterday’s televised convening, under caretaker PM auspices, of a ministerial-level meeting; Syrian officials are cited denying SNC claims that a number of ministers had recently defected. Reports in Iranian state television mentioned plans yesterday to organise a regional-level meeting to consider the Syrian crisis while other media sources refer to senior Iranian officials visiting Turkey and Syria for high-level talks (recalling opposition forces’ continued detention of a number of Iranian nationals). Rebels were cited yesterday warning that three Iranian captives had been killed in a government air strike in Damascus governorate; in the face of continued SAAF attacks, they reportedly threatened to kill others. Meanwhile, UNSMIS’ leadership was cited yesterday expressing concern about escalating violence. There is still-unconfirmed word of ongoing heavy fighting in ALEPPO. Shelling in DAMASCUS, DEIR EZ-ZOR and HOMS also continues to be reported by the Mission; most recently, however, there appears to be an overall slackening of the intensity of fighting in these locations. A patrol dispatched to YALDA found much of the town deserted and locals alleging upwards of 150 people killed in the area (Alawite and Iranian elements were blamed). French officials announced yesterday the planned deployment (this week) of military medical assistance to locations in Jordan, near the border with Syria. Turkish officials are cited claiming that the past 24 hours have seen some 1,300 more refugees (and a small number of military defectors) cross the border.

The same sources refer to two militants killed in Kishtwar district yesterday; it is speculated that one of the dead militants was involved in the September 2011 attack on court premises in DELHI. "
6-Aug-12,UNSMIS,"  Following last Friday’s adoption of the UNGA resolution, SNC notables announced on Saturday their willingness to negotiate, assuming President al-Assad’s departure, with government figures whose hands “are not stained with blood”. Qatar’s PM was cited the same day warning that any replacement for JSE Annan must be clearly mandated to negotiate a transfer a power in Syria. Other reports refer to efforts by Qatar and Turkey to help secure the release of 48 Iranians who were detained at a shrine by anti-government elements in DAMASCUS.

Meanwhile, state television premises in DAMASCUS were reportedly targeted in an explosion today. Also today, opposition sources allege a “massacre” having taken place in Hama governorate, at HARBNASA. UNSMIS reports a continued deterioration of circumstances in and around ALEPPO, with ongoing use of artillery, aircraft, helicopters and heavy weapons. TS personnel there were temporarily relocated to DAMASCUS in response to nearby fighting yesterday. FSA elements in Idlib governorate intercepted an UNMO patrol to ALEPPO on Saturday; yesterday, two UNMOs elsewhere in Idlib sustained minor injuries in a vehicle accident. Persistent fire prompted a suspension of patrolling in DEIR EZ-ZOR while, in HOMS, there are contradictory reports of continued fighting. In RASTAN, the Mission has not been able to confirm opposition allegations of heavy shelling and food shortages. In DAMASCUS, SAAF troops continue to clear opposition elements from several parts of the city. On Saturday, UNMOs observed shelling of the Zamalka neighbourhood; yesterday, SAAF troops prevented UNMO access to DAMASCUS’ Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp, which has been the subject of recent reports of shelling. The Mission has yet to confirm authorities’ allegations of a mass grave in the capital’s Tadamon district. There was also unconfirmed word yesterday of Syrian troop deployments toward DOUMA.  "
6-Aug-12,UNDOF,"  Following the 30 July abduction of a Syrian forces’ liaison officer by purported FSA combatants, remaining SSAD officers are seeking new measures to ensure their personal security while undertaking inspections with Mission personnel. Meanwhile, UNDOF reports continued instances of unauthorised military personnel and equipment within the AoS, most recently near UFANIYAH and JABBATA. Last Friday saw four civilians (claiming FSA affiliation) warn UNMOs of alleged SAAF plans to attack near JABBATA; they further threatened to engage UN positions if no action was taken in response to a local Syrian offensive. On Saturday, UNDOF assisted a civilian who sustained gunshot injuries from IDF troops after attempting to breach a technical fence near UN position 80, in the southern Golan. "
6-Aug-12,UNIFIL,  There have been a number of recent instances of demonstrated hostility against peacekeepers. Patrol members had weapons trained on them by IDF personnel on Saturday near RUMAYSH.

6-Aug-12,Sudan,"  Following agreement reached last Friday under Tripartite auspices, an MoU signed in KHARTOUM yesterday – effective for an initial period of 90 days and subject to renewal – commits Sudanese authorities to facilitate the provision of humanitarian assistance in Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan. (A similar MoU, making mention of the need for GoS-enabled access, was developed and signed by the SPLM-N on Saturday.) Meanwhile, reports yesterday referred to a national agency staff member killed when his vehicle was fired upon north of KADUGLI.  "
6-Aug-12,UNMISS,"  Last Friday saw agreement reached under AUHIP auspices (but not yet signed) on matters of oil transit, processing and associated transportation fees. South Sudanese and Sudanese officials also agreed on the GRSS’ transfer of some $US 3 billion, over a period of 3.5 years, to cover a portion of Sudan’s estimated revenue shortfall. The AU has also engaged, this past Saturday, newly-appointed members of the Panel of Experts for border issues. Subsequently, delegation members departed ADDIS ABABA and, following a brief break for the Eid holiday, are due to reconvene on 24 August. A presidential summit is planned for mid-September. Meanwhile, militia activity in Jonglei state continues to be of concern for local officials. The Mission received word yesterday of fighting at KHORFULUS between SPLA troops and remnants of militia affiliated with George Athor. Eleven civilian vehicles contracted by UNMISS were commandeered by SPLA soldiers in Unity state this past Friday.  "
6-Aug-12,UNAMID,"  Tensions persisted over the weekend in and around KUTUM (Northern Darfur) where, following earlier inter-communal violence, armed militia have surrounded the local IDP camp and have prevented peacekeeper access (the Mission has since reported that most IDP camp residents have fled). Militia elements and SAF troops have clashed, with mortar shells impacting close to UNAMID base camp premises. Peacekeepers at FATA BORNO, where a police station was ransacked last Friday, have been reinforced and are providing protection to numbers of recently displaced arrivals. In Southern Darfur, a patrol from SHAERIA was advised yesterday to curtail its movements due to ongoing SAF operations against suspected JEM rebels. Elsewhere in the state, a peacekeeper was injured while on patrol near GEREIDA last Friday. Yesterday in NYALA, armed assailants forced a Bank of Khartoum vehicle off the road; a large sum of cash intended for UN use was surrendered by the car’s occupants.

Five Ivorian security personnel were believed killed in these attacks. An FRCI camp north of ABIDAN, at ABENGOUROU, was also attacked yesterday; the attackers were repulsed and calm has since been restored. Most recently, today in ABIDJAN, other FRCI premises (co-habited by a UNOCI peacekeeping contingent) were targeted in an attack today; the attack was contained but at least four Ivorian soldiers were killed.  "
6-Aug-12,MONUSCO,"  Some 80 people, including representatives from political parties and civil society, participated in a national advisory group meeting this past Saturday, chaired by President Kabila, on the situation in eastern DRC. This initiative follows the ICGLR meeting in KHARTOUM last Thursday at which defence ministers decided to, inter alia, seek assistance from the AU and the UN in establishing a so-called “neutral international force”; also planned is the full activation of the Joint Intelligence Fusion Centre, in GOMA, by 30 August. This past Saturday also saw Rwandan officials publish an official 131-page rebuttal to the UN GoE report. Meanwhile, CENI officials announced last Friday that the election of national deputies in Masisi territory (North Kivu) could not be organised; the presence of armed groups, the displacement of the population and logistical challenges were given as reasons.  "
6-Aug-12,UNAMA,"  Citing allegations of corruption and alleged incompetence, this past Saturday saw Afghan lawmakers pass votes of no confidence against the country’s interior and defence minister. President Karzai is cited announcing his intent to retain both individuals as “caretakers” until replacements can be found. Reports last Friday referred to an explosion within a mosque in Nangarhar province; other reports mentioned recent tensions between the Pashtun and Hazara communities following an attack last week.  "
6-Aug-12,UNMOGIP,  There was local media speculation last Friday that five Indian military officers were found guilty of maintaining ties with a banned organisation (believed a militant Islamic group). The Mission reports that the same day saw an LeT insurgent commander killed by security forces in Kupwara district (India-administered Kashmir). 
3-Aug-12,UNSMIS,"  It was announced yesterday that JSE Annan would not be seeking an extension of his mandate beyond 31 August; mention was made of parties’ intransigence and divisions within the UNSC. Yesterday saw Syrian officials reiterate accusations of external support of “terrorist” activity in Syria, with references to Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Israel and the US. The UK has reportedly announced its intent today to provide additional non-military support to rebels. Russian media reports refer to the anticipated arrival, via three landing ships, of a contingent of Russian marines at TARTUS. Also today, there is local media speculation that two senior uniformed officers – one from Syria’s MoI, the other affiliated with the country’s military academy – have defected. Other unconfirmed local media sources (from Lebanon) refer to clashes between the SAAF and elements of the Jordanian military. Meanwhile, significant combat operations continue to be reported in disparate locations, including in DEIR EZ-ZOR and HOMS. Some 50 people were reportedly killed as a result of shelling and activity by security forces in HAMA. FSA representatives claim today to control 50 percent of ALEPPO, where UNSMIS has noted the ongoing employment of artillery, heavy weapons and helicopters (media sources refer to ground attacks conducted by fighter aircraft). Citing communication difficulties, the Mission is temporarily re-locating some personnel from ALEPPO to UNSMIS HQ today. Government and opposition sources both report ongoing fighting south of TALBISA while an overall decrease in violence has been recently reported in DAMASCUS. American officials decided yesterday to approve an additional $US 12 million in humanitarian aid.  "

3-Aug-12,Lebanon,  There is unconfirmed word today of Syrian artillery fire continuing to impact bordering locations in Lebanon.  
3-Aug-12,UNMISS,"  America’s secretary of state arrived in JUBA today. As of late yesterday, AU-facilitated talks in ADDIS ABABA have not yielded a comprehensive agreement on the main issues dividing GRSS and Sudan. Of particular mention is the lack of agreement on the SDBZ and the consequent inability to make the JBVMM operational (the deployment of national monitors to ASSOSA notwithstanding). Continued negotiations concerning oil transit matters were reported, as were further talks concerning humanitarian access. Meanwhile, the Mission is today investigating persistent concerns of cross-border communal tensions impacting the security situation in and around MOGOS. Elsewhere in Eastern Equatoria state, in TORIT, a local was arrested yesterday after throwing a stone and damaging a UN vehicle. In Jonglei state’s Likuangole payam, the Mission has received word of SPLA responses to the reported presence of some 35 armed militia affiliated with David Yau Yau.

"
3-Aug-12,UNAMID,"  A number of UN agency and NGO staff were re-located to EL FASHER yesterday in response to the earlier looting of WFP premises in KUTUM (Northern Darfur). The local security situation remains tense, with the Mission expressing concern that associated violence (of an inter-communal nature) will spread to nearby areas.  "
3-Aug-12,UNISFA,"  There is continued disagreement in ADDIS ABABA concerning the composition of the Executive Council, with the GRSS claiming that Sudan’s nominated candidates are not Ngok Dinka. The AUHIP’s proposal on the matter is expected to be presented in late August or early September, at the presidential summit that was originally due to take place on 31 July.  "
3-Aug-12,MONUSCO,"  This past Wednesday saw Banyamulenge community leaders express concern about their safety as a result of their refusal to join M23 rebels against the government; it was claimed to MONUSCO that this issue of Banyamulenge intransigence is openly discussed in Rwanda. Meanwhile, the Mission continues to monitor M23-related developments in North Kivu. There were reports yesterday of M23 and UPCP militia elements organising a meeting in BUVUNGA at which it was announced that a recruitment effort will take place in RUMANGABO. There is belated word of the M23’s announced establishment, on 31 July, of a parallel administration in Rutshuru territory; a CNDP-affiliated individual was appointed “Administrator”. Persistent tensions in the province continue to prompt locals to displace themselves; estimates suggest that some 220,000 persons have been affected over the past three months. There are also increased numbers of Congolese refugees reported in Uganda. On Wednesday, UNHCR announced that upwards of 10,000 people have been recently repatriated to locations in Equateur province.  "
3-Aug-12,UNOCI,  Yesterday saw ICC officials postpone the planned confirmation of charges against Mr. Gbagbo; the need to confirm the ex-president’s fitness to participate was cited as reason. This past Wednesday saw several agreements signed by which France will provide significant assistance to Côte d’Ivoire’s security sector.  
3-Aug-12,Somalia," (UNSOA)  Yesterday, making reference to recent NCA activity, al-Shabaab threatened to target anyone participating in the constitutional debates or who voted on the matter.  "
3-Aug-12,UNMOGIP,"  There is local media interest in the reported discovery by Indian authorities of a 400 m tunnel dug in Samba district, near the border in India-administered Kashmir.  "
3-Aug-12,UNAMA,  Afghanistan’s finance minister is reportedly being investigated on suspicion of corruption; he was cited yesterday denying any wrongdoing. Yesterday also saw Afghan officials claim to have foiled insurgent plans to undertake a significant terrorist attack in KABUL; five suspected attackers were killed in an exchange of fire with security forces. 
2-Aug-12,UNSMIS,"  There is interest in the anticipated adjustment of the UN’s presence in Syria; reports make mention of yesterday’s Syria Steering Group meeting and today’s anticipated UNSC consultations. American officials stated yesterday that $US 25 million had been made available for non-lethal assistance to rebel forces (other sources have recently speculated on a growing US commitment of covert assistance to anti-government elements). Media sources reported yesterday on the conduct of a military exercise involving Turkish armoured elements near the border with Syria. The Syrian opposition’s deployment of armoured vehicles and other heavy weapons (including at ALEPPO) was also reported yesterday, albeit with a significant degree of ambiguity and uncertainty (as of today, the Mission cannot confirm this). Meanwhile – and notwithstanding recent significant communications disruption – the Mission reports a continued deterioration of the security situation in ALEPPO, including persistent use of heavy weapons, indirect fire and armed helicopters. FSA notables claim to control 70 percent of the city even as a video posted online yesterday purports to show FSA executions of loyalist elements there. Unconfirmed media reports today refer to rebels’ use of artillery against a nearby military airfield. Opposition sniper fire is the suspected source of a round which impacted a patrolling UN vehicle in ALEPPO’s Salah al-Din district; no-one was injured. As regards other locations in Syria, UNMOs have been able to visit a hospital in DEIR EZ-ZOR, where continued use of artillery is reported. Heavy weapons’ use continues in HAMA and in HOMS, which is one of several locations reportedly experiencing power shortages. In DAMASCUS today, security forces have reportedly conducted a series of raids resulting in upwards of 35 people killed. Also today, media reports refer to heavy shelling at AZAZ, near the border with Turkey. There are unconfirmed reports of Syrian artillery fire again impacting Lebanese territory. FAO estimates today that 1.5 million people in Syria are in need of immediate assistance; WFP announced yesterday that 28,000 ALEPPO residents will receive food assistance.  "
2-Aug-12,UNDOF,  The Mission continues to report instances of unauthorised military personnel and equipment in the AoS and AoL.  
2-Aug-12,Sudan,"  Recalling today’s UNSC deadline for AU-facilitated post-secession negotiations to be concluded, GoS and SPLM-N representatives are believed to have agreed to a “humanitarian cessation of hostilities in principle” (as regards circumstances in Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan). Specific mention is made of the government’s readiness to work with the Tripartite mechanism; to this end, a joint operational committee is to be formed next week in KHARTOUM. Meanwhile, Sudanese officials are reportedly seeking American support of bilateral efforts to resolve outstanding matters with the GRSS.  "
2-Aug-12,UNMISS,"  Senior SPLA officials were cited yesterday denying earlier rumours in local media of a coup being planned – and a number of arrests made as a result – against President Kiir. Meanwhile, the potential for cross-border violence stemming from persistent inter-communal tensions remains; the Mission is monitoring the recent reported movement of Murle from PIBOR (Jonglei state) toward locations in Eastern Equatoria state’s Kapoeta East county.  "
2-Aug-12,UNISFA,"  This past Tuesday, Sudan’s representative requested a postponement of the planned 05 August AJOC meeting; it has been tentatively rescheduled for 10 August and will take place at UNISFA HQ. Meanwhile, heavy rain, inaccessible roads and TCC rotation requirements have hindered recent patrolling activity.  "
2-Aug-12,UNAMID,"  The situation in NYALA (Southern Darfur) is calm today, with no reports of demonstrations and Sudanese security forces deployed at strategic locations. In Northern Darfur, following the recent shooting death of the Alwaha district commissioner, the Mission informs today of a number of people killed when Arab militia targeted the local market, a police post and a nearby IDP camp (there are also unverified reports of WFP premises in KUTUM being attacked and looted by armed elements). Elsewhere in the state, at SHANGIL TOBAYA, a significant SAF convoy was observed yesterday moving toward DAR AL SALAM.  "
2-Aug-12,MONUSCO,"  This past Tuesday, in RUTSHURU centre (North Kivu), M23 elements allegedly organised a small parade of PNC defectors in a show of force intended to convince other officers to join their ranks. Rebels continue to collect illegal taxes in the area; they also anticipate the opening of police premises at KIWANJA. FARDC (with MONUSCO logistical assistance) continues to undertake regular patrols along the KATANDA-RWINDI-KABASHA axis.

3-Jul-12,MONUSCO,"   Yesterday saw CENI officials respond to criticism levied during two days of discussions in the National Assembly regarding the conduct of 2011 elections, stressing the influence of limited resources in determining the adoption of “flexible” methods and denouncing electoral observers’ reports as lacking credibility. In eastern DRC, there are reports that M23 rebels have established training centres at KIKUKU and KIRYAMO. Separately, Mission sources shared word of an attack carried out by suspected Mayi-Mayi in the MPATI IDP camp late last week, forcing some 300 people to seek refuge close to nearby MONUSCO premises.

2-Jul-12,UNSMIS,"  An Arab League-sponsored conference of Syrian opposition groups is being held in CAIRO today to discuss a proposed transition plan for Syria; foreign government officials are reportedly in attendance. There is speculation, however, that Syria-based activists intend to boycott the gathering. This comes on the heels of the Action Group meeting that concluded in GENEVA this past Saturday with the adoption of a final communiqué; notably, participants agreed on a set of principles and guidelines on a Syrian-led transition requiring clear and irreversible steps, including the establishment of a transitional governing body that could include members of the present government and the opposition. Opposition SNC notables rejected the new plan yesterday, describing it as ambiguous and a waste of time. Pro-Syrian government media similarly described the meeting as a failure; the government has yet to formally react. Media reports today refer to Russian government intent to meet with Syrian opposition leaders in MOSCOW in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, violence continues unabated; this past weekend saw reports of continued shelling and fighting involving the use of tanks and combat helicopters against opposition targets in DEIR EZ-ZOR (UNSMIS efforts to facilitate humanitarian access have thus far been unsuccessful). Shelling was also reported in HOMS, DAR’A, IDLIB, as well as in several suburbs of DAMASCUS. In the northern city of ALEPPO, local officials claimed this past Saturday that a car bomb attack resulted in significant damage to a government building. In HAMA, UNMOs visited a local hospital this past Saturday after receiving word that pro-government militia elements had killed at least 30 people in the nearby village of SOURAN; there were conflicting reports on the number of civilians killed. According to opposition activists, an explosion in the ZAMALKA suburb of DAMASCUS this past Saturday during a funeral procession was caused by a vehicle-borne suicide bomb. In DAR’A, UNMOs report finding numerous injured Palestinian refugees during a visit to a local hospital, but were unable to ascertain more details. Separately, the Mission has yet to confirm reports that government forces recaptured DOUMA (outside DAMASCUS); reportedly, a joint team of SARC and ICRC workers were able to enter the city yesterday. Other reports yesterday referred to Turkish fighter jets flying close to the border with Syria in response to the latter helicopters’ manoeuvring in the area; there was no confrontation or violation of Turkish airspace. Reports today suggest that rocket fire from Lebanon injured two Syrian border police officers.   "
2-Jul-12,UNDOF,"  UNTSO personnel continue to experience restrictions of movement and threatening behaviour by Syrian personnel, most recently this past Saturday at a SAAF checkpoints in KAFR NASIJ and KAFR SHAMS, in violation of the Agreement; UNDOF will lodge the necessary protests with Syrian authorities.

2-Jul-12,MONUSCO,"  The Mission belatedly reported that the CENI presented its report on last year’s elections to the National Assembly this past Thursday, promising to adjust the voter’s registry and the placement of polling stations, improve the recruitment of CENI agents in the field, and enhance the security of the electoral process. Meanwhile, relations between the Congolese and Rwandan governments remain tense, amidst reports of continued fighting involving M23 elements in North Kivu; President Kabila blamed the unrest in eastern DRC on “dark forces, national and foreign” during a televised speech on Friday, but stopped short of explicitly referring to Rwanda. US officials were cited by media the following day calling on Rwanda to stop supporting armed rebel groups in the DRC. In other news, this past Friday saw the UNSC urge international support to AU-led efforts against the LRA.   "

Mention is made of some states requiring that prior agreement be reached on a JSE Annan (draft) proposal for “guidelines and principles for a Syrian-led political transition”; discussions to this effect are reportedly expected between American and Russian officials in ST. PETERSBURG later today. Also today, there is word of senior Action Group officials gathering in a preparatory meeting which took place at 0900 hrs GMT. Media reports yesterday cited SNC and Muslim Brotherhood representatives, among others, rejecting any inclusion of al-Assad loyalists in a proposed transitional government. France’s foreign minister reportedly intends to meet with SNC notables today while, yesterday, there was word that European officials intend to seek a Chapter VII resolution adopted by the UNSC.

27-Jun-12,UNSMIS,"  The question of which member states will be invited to participate in Saturday’s planned “contact group” meeting in GENEVA is of media interest today. There was interest yesterday in UNSMIS’ inability, due to heavy fighting, to resume full-scale monitoring activity (the Mission reports today that it has conducted patrols to hospitals in ALEPPO, DAR’A, TARTUS and in the larger DAMASCUS area and has recommenced patrolling in IDLIB, which has been popularly received).

There was also media interest yesterday in talks between UN Independent Commission of Inquiry and senior government officials in DAMASCUS to pave the way for an investigation into violence in the country. Other media sources this morning reported heavy fighting in and outside DAMASCUS, including around Republican Guard HQ premises; Syrian security forces have reportedly used artillery in response. Opposition activists also reported heavy shelling in the town of SARAQEB, and in HOMS. Mission sources reported continued violence across the country, notably in ALEPPO, MA’RABA, HOMS and DEIR EZ-ZOR, where government forces continue to refuse to guarantee safe passage to UNMOs.

Congolese media today call for a general mobilization against the war. In GOMA, a motion of no-confidence against provincial assembly bureau members was tabled by a group of 30 MPs yesterday. Elsewhere in North Kivu, FDLR activity is reportedly leading to population displacements towards KANYABAYONGA. Tensions between the Hunde and Hutu communities over the past few days have similarly forced locals to flee towards MASISI. Far to the north, Mayi-Mayi combatants involved in a recent attack in the Epolu reserve are reportedly collecting illegal taxes from locals along the MAMBASA-KISANGANI road; MONUSCO is supporting FARDC troop deployment to the area.   "
26-Jun-12,UNMIL,"  The recent extradition of Ivorian nationals continues to generate controversy; Senator Prince Johnson told UNMIL yesterday that the move could trigger inter-ethnic tensions in Nimba and Grand Gedeh counties.
